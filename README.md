# Obfuscation and Pixelation Browser-based Tool
### No Dependencies

## What does it do?
This tool allows you to load an image and pixelate/obfuscate regions, and also allows for multiple selections. Once you're done, it allows you to save the file (as a download).

## What format does it save as?
This will always save the image as PNG.

## What files can I open?
Most image files should be able to be opened, but there may be an exception. This should work perfectly with JPG, PNG, TIFF, and BMP files.
